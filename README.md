# Rohlik-Chrome-Extension

## About
Web scraping extension created for Chrome which allows you to view current prices of products listed on [rohlik.cz](https://rohlik.cz/) in one small popup.

Popup looks currently like this:

## How to use it

### Adding new product
On [rohlik.cz](https://rohlik.cz/) search a product you would like to add on the list. After you visit the page with your desired item, there should be a new button "add to the list". Click on it.
If the button isn't there, try reloading the page. That should fix it.
Also make sure that URL in your adress bar matches your desired product name. If not, you need to click on the name of the product to be reddirected to right URL so extension can save correct adress.

<i>URL clearly does not match product name</i>

### Removing a product
In the popup just click on the minus button next to the product price - that will remove the product from the list permanently. Of course you can add it back if you want to.

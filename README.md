# Rohlik-Chrome-Extension

## About
Web scraping extension created for Chrome which allows you to view current prices of products listed on [rohlik.cz](https://rohlik.cz/) in one small popup. Currently it uses only JavaScript.

Popup looks currently like this:

## How to use it

### Adding new product
On [rohlik.cz](https://rohlik.cz/) search a product you would like to add on the list. After you visit the page with your desired item, there should be a new button "add to the list". Click on it.
If the button isn't there, try reloading the page. That should fix it.

### Removing a product
In the popup just click on the minus button next to the product price - that will remove the product from the list permanently. Of course you can add it back if you want to.
